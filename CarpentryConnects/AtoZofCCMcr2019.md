### I: Icebreaker, Inclusion

#### Icebreaker

Many people coming to CarpentryConnect will be meeting for the first time. We know that coming into any big event for the first time can be a little intimidating. You may not know anyone but it seems like everyone else knows lots of people. We want to make sure that everyone who comes to CarpentryConnect feels a sense of belonging right from the start. As the first activity at the conference, we have planned an icebreaker event for everyone to connect with a small group of people to swap stories about why they are here.

#### Inclusion

We want to create an inclusive and welcoming environment at the conference. We are providing travel assistance to facilitate attendance from as wide a group as possible. We are collecting full details to identify needs for childcare and mobility, accessibility and dietary preferences during registration. Feel free to reach out to the organisers and staff if they can improve your participation at CarpentryConnect. (also see *Allies, Carpentries, Code of Conduct, Diversity, Emergency*)

### K: Keynote Speakers, Knowledge sharing

#### Keynote Speakers

We have fantastic keynote speakers lined up for you at CarpentryCon. Our 4 speakers are: **Tracy Teal** (Executive Director, The Carpentries), **Marta Taperek** (Data Stewardship Coordinator at TU Delft, The Netherlands), **Lex Nederbragt** (Head of Education and Training for the Centre for Bioinformatics, University of Oslo), **Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel** (Associate Professor of the Practice in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University and a professional educator at RStudio). We are very excited to have these leaders from their field at CarpentryConnect and are looking forward to their talks. See the [official website](https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19) for more detail.

#### Knowledge sharing

We, as organisers, have put a lot of efforts into making sure that you get several opportunities to learn new skills and ideas while expanding your network. In this 3-day high-intensity conference you will learn from: (1) the experts, through keynote talks, skill-up session, and workshops, (2) the new members, by sharing ideas with each other at discussion/breakout sessions and get tips from the session leads and other attendees. At the conference, you will be surrounded by the community leaders and trainers, and everyone is seeking to learn. We can assure you that you will get much more than 'just another conference experience', if you reach out to your neighbor during coffee breaks, at the watercoolers, while sharing charging stations, at lunches, in the breakout rooms, and at conference receptions.

### L: Lightning talks, Library Carpentry

#### Lightning talks

We have lightning talk sessions on the first and second day of the conference. Each lightning talk presenter will get 3 minutes to present their topics. Please see the [conference program](https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme) for the complete schedule. The abstract submission for this session is closed.

#### Library Carpentry

Library Carpentry, is made by librarians, for librarians to help you automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks, create, maintain and analyse sustainable and reusable data, work effectively with IT and systems colleagues, better understand the use of software in research and much more.

#### Manchester

Manchester city in Greater Manchester, England is home to over 545,500 ethnically and linguistically diverse people. This city started the industrial revolution, claims to be the birthplace for vegetarianism in Britain, this is where the “splitting of atom” was defined, and boasts about being first in several occasions in history (see [this blog](http://www.wow247.co.uk/2016/01/22/bizarre-facts-manchester/) for bizarre facts!). Clearly, Manchester has a lot to offer to the conference participants during their visit to this lovely city. See [this post by University of Manchester](https://www.intostudy.com/en/universities/the-university-of-manchester/living-in-manchester) for useful information about Manchester.

#### Medical

If you have any specific medical needs, let the organisers know in advance so that they make the necessary arrangements for you. We will have basic medication and first aid support at the venue. Please see *Emergency* for detail on emergency, non-emergency and pharmacy contacts.

#### Mentoring

Mentorship is an important part of the Carpentry experience. As Instructors, we both teach and mentor our Learners. We also mentor each other as Instructors, learning something new from each other every time we teach and interact with one another. This event a fantastic opportunity to interact with other Carpentry Instructors from around the world. 

### N: New Members, Name Tags

#### New Members

Are you new to The Carpentries? Do you want to learn more about the organisation and how you can support it? CarpentryConnect is the place for you. You will have an opportunity for face-to-face networking and interaction with other members. We understand that it could be frightening if you don't know anyone, but the community has a history of being very friendly and inclusive, so don't be afraid to say 'Hi' and introduce yourself. You will be surprised how many lasting collaborations you will make at the conference. Join the social events and ice-breaking session to get a head start to networking, and when in doubt, contact the organisers.

#### Name Tags

Name tags are a great way for participants to strike up conversations with other participants or volunteers. You can collect your name tag at the registration desk. Don't forget to bring your registration ticket, and if possible a lanyards and badges from a previous conference to recycle ([see detail](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-04-24-can-we-increase-our-impact-reducing-it-thoughts-environmental-sustainability)). Our name tags will have a section to add your pronoun preference and add a sticker if you prefer not to be photographed at the event. As a participant, be respectful to each other by using the correct name and pronoun. Ask! if you don't know how to pronounce someone's name, maybe they will share a nice story about what their name means.

### O: Organising Committee

The organisers of this event is the ([Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://software.ac.uk)). Aleksandra Nenadic, the training lead, is the chair of the conference, who is working with SSI staff and community members to make this conference a success with your participation.

Vasilis Lenis, Aleksandra Nenadic, Giacomo Peru, Fotis Psomopoulos, Malvika Sharan, Graeme Smith and Peter Smyth. Don’t forget to say ‘Hi’ to them!

### P: Pronouns, Photography, Posters, Power adapters, Post-conference

#### Pronouns

It has become a general practice to share pronouns (He/She/They/Ze etc.) on conference name tags. For those unfamiliar with the practice of sharing pronouns at the conference, it goes something like this: “Name: Malvika Sharan. Pronouns: she/her”. This practice is important for making sure that we use correct pronouns, specifically for our trans, queer, and gender non-conforming community members you will meet at CarpentryConnect.

#### Photography

You are allowed to take photographs at the conference. Make sure that you do not disturb any session or others in the process. We will offer a specific stickers for the badges for those who **don't want to be photographed**. Be respectful of their decision and don't take/post their pictures on social media. A few volunteers will be taking pictures to be included to the official collection, you are welcome to join them. If you want to post pictures on social media, use the hastag #ccmcr2019 to tag the conference, so that other attendees and those who couldn't join the conference can find your posts.

#### Posters

We will have a poster session and a designated area for the display of posters. You should use the A0 poster size (vertical). Any other specifications will be added if required. The abstract submission for this session is over. The poster session will take place on the first evening of the conference.

#### Power Adapters

1) Bring a Type-G (compatible) power adapter. Check the requirements [here](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/ie/england/).
2) If you are using your laptop for a presentation, bring your adapter to connect it with the projector (HDMI or VGA).
3) If you have any errors while running your program, send a tweet or ask for help on the Slack channels.

We will have on-site technical support at the conference. A few volunteers will be willing to help you with any technical difficulties that you might face at the conference. You can inquire about this at the helpdesk or by directly approaching the organisers.

#### Post-conference

The post-conference period will be equally crucial to evaluate the success of the conference. The organisers will send out a post-conference survey to learn about your experiences from this conference and suggestions for the next one. The organisers will also publish a post conference report and accept blog submission from the conference participants.

### Q: Queries, Quiet Rooms

If you are vegan/vegetarian, Manchester will provide to several tempting options to explore its restaurants and cafes ([10 recommendations](http://www.manchestersfinest.com/eating-and-drinking/restaurants/best-places-to-go-for-vegetarian-food-in-manchester/)). 

We want to be able to provide you catering keeping your dietary restrictions into account (e.g. Veg(itari)ans, Gluten-free, Nut-free etc). Make sure that you provide your preference while registering. If you are still wondering if you would like to give vegetarianism a try, you can accept Aleksandra Nenadic invitation to take the vegetarian challenge for the duration of the conference (see her [blog](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-04-24-can-we-increase-our-impact-reducing-it-thoughts-environmental-sustainability)).

#### Weather

The temperature during the conference, as per the AccuWeather-forecast, will be 12-21 Degree Celcius. Weather in manchester is subjected to have clouds, sun and a few showers during the conference and it is not unusual unusual atoll to have them all in one day. A good strategy is to resort to layered clothing and to bring waterproof shoes and jackets.

#### Workshops

On the third day of the conference, we will run several parallel workshop sessions. There will be a limited number of seats available for each of these workshops and will be filled by first-come-first-served basis. See the [conference program](https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme) beforehand to shortlist a few sessions of your interest for which you can register on-spot.

#### Wireless

Wireless networks are available at the conference venues. Venue specific wireless information will be shared at the conference sites. You will also be able to use [Eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/about/connect-yourself/) which should be set up at your home institution before your travel to Manchester. 

#### Waste minimisation

Large events are known to produce a large amount of waste material in several stages, starting from traveling overseas to using paper cups. We have tried to take the philosophy of ‘sustainability’ beyond software development, by adopting a few ideas in our organisation workflow, which includes reusing lanyard and badges, not using plastic packaging and cutlery for the catering, minimising the printed materials, and be conscious of efforts made by our participants. We encourage you to avoid buying packaged water bottles and coffee mugs, by bringing your own reusable bottle and coffee mugs at the conference.
